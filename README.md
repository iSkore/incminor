# C in C


Create a for loop that continues to iterate `$i` with no condition telling it when to stop:

	for( $i = 0;; $i++ )

Create a statement informing the machine instructions to print ASCII characters

	print pack(

Iterated the following value and is denoted by `"n"`

	"n", ( ( (

Get `$i` and multiply it by `$i` shifted right 8 times, and on the 8th time, when `$i >> 8` is no longer a value of multiplicable capability, shift it 9 times to start over

	$i * ( $i >> 8 | $i >> 9 )
